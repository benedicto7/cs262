1. What do the hooks in this code do?

The isLoading hook sets the state of the ActivityIndicator, which decides if the data will be shown or not.
The data hook stores the data. 

2. Modify the URL to some invalid value and explain how the code responds.

The code sometimes fetches and sometimes doesn't. When it doesn't, it shows network request failed.
