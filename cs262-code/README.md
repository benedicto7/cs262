### Getting Started

To use this code, do the following:
1. Clone this `cs262-code` repo to your local machine and use it as a reference
    as you develop your own solution code.
2. Create your own CS 262 code repo on GitHub:
```https://github.com/GITHUB_ID/cs262```. You can do this by:
    1. Creating a new `cs262` repo on GitHub.
    2. Cloning that repo to your local machine (or machines) as a sibling of your `cs262-code` repo.
    3. Adding/Committing/Pushing your solution files.

You will push your own `cs262` repo weekly, as appropriate.
You should pull updates from the `cs262-code` repo regularly to pick any changes 
we may make.
